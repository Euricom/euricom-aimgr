## Keep It Simple:

- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Use standard libraries and patterns when possible

## Project Structure

- Organize the project into the following folders:
  - `src/`: All source code files.
  - `bin/`: Entry point scripts.
- Ensure the entry point is defined in `package.json` under `"bin"`.

## Coding Standards

- Follow the Airbnb TypeScript style guide.
- Use OXlint linting.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
- Prefer functional and declarative programming patterns. Use classes judiciously when they provide clear benefits (e.g., for implementing interfaces, managing complex state, or encapsulating related behavior).
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.

# Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories & files(e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use the \*.spec.ts file naming convention for writing unit tests.

# TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; object typed `as const` are preferred.
- Use advanced TypeScript features (type guards, mapped types, conditional types)

## Dependencies and Tools

- Use `commander` for command-line argument parsing.
- Use `consola` for improved CLI output.
- Add `debug` for debug logging.

## Testing

- Write unit tests using Vitest.
- Place all unit tests next to the corresponding source file.

## Git usage

Commit message Prefixes:

- "fix: " for bug fixes
- "feat: " for new features
- "perf: " for performance improvements
- "docs: " for documentation changes
- "style: " for formatting and css changes
- "refactor: " for code refactoring
- "test: " for adding missing integration and unit tests
- "chore: " for chore/build/deploy tasks

Rules

- use lower case for commit messages
- keep the summery line concise
- when determining the commit prefix, pick the most relevant prefix from the list above
- the commit message should also include a list of the changes made in the commit after the summary line if changes are not self explanatory
- reference issue numbers when applicable
